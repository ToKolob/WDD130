    <h2>Lucas Nunes</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Lucas Nunes. I'm currently studying Software Development at university. I really enjoy playing games with my wife and friends, especially since we got married earlier this year.</p>
    <p>Before I started my studies, I used to work at a big bank in Brazil. But I wasn't happy with the job's honesty, so I decided to change careers to work with something I love, which is technology.</p>
    <p>Whenever I face tough times, I find strength in my favorite scripture, D&C 122.</p>
    <p class="scrip">7 And if thou shouldst be cast into the apit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the bdeep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to chedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of dhell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee eexperience, and shall be for thy good.</p>
    <p class="scrip">8 The aSon of Man hath bdescended below them all. Art thou greater than he?</p>

      
    <p>I've been connected to the church since my parents got baptized when I was three. I have a special memory of when they got married forever in the SÃ£o Paulo temple when I was seven years old.</p>
